      In his debut music album Dance Party, he collaborated with veteran singer
      SP Balasubrahmanyam's son S. P. Charan. He then composed score and
      soundtrack of the 1999 Telugu film Devi, thus marking his debut as a film
      music composer at the age of 19.[20] Devi made his breakthrough with the
      soundtrack album of the film Anandam in the same year, marking his first
      collaboration with director Srinu Vaitla. He has written and sung the song
      "Premante Emitante" and lent his vocals for another song titled
      "Monalisa". Idlebrain stated that, "music of the film is good though some
      of the tunes are inspired by 'back street boys' work. Background music is
      impressive. Devi Sri Prasad has got a chance to work with a fulltime love
      story, which has scope for good music".[21] This is his first major
      successful film album. In the same year, he composed film score for a
      Tamil film Badri. This marks his debut in Tamil cinema.[22][23] 2002–2005:
      Rise to prominence In 2002, he had five album releases, including
      soundtrack albums of the films Kalusukovalani, Manmadhudu and Sontham
      became the biggest chartbusters of the time. These films were critically
      and commercially successful, music composition by DSP also contributed to
      the films' successes. Films Sontham and Manmadhudu were regarded as
      musical hits of the year. Most of the songs in these albums were widely
      appreciated.[24] A critic writing for Manmadhudu review, stated that
      "Music by Devi Sri Prasad is excellent. Even the background score is
      pretty good. The picturization of the songs has elevated the audio of
      Manmadhudu."[25] The same year, devi composed music for a patriotic film
      Khadgam. Krishna Prasad Chigurupati of The Times of India wrote: " ‘Meme
      Indians’ composed by Devi Sri Prasad depicts the real attitude and unity
      among Indians with a hint of satire and humour."[26] "Nuvvu Nuvvu" sung by
      Sumangali is another biggest hit of the album.[27] Although the film
      Varsham was released in 2004, its soundtrack album was released on 18
      December 2003 through Aditya Music at the film's audio launch event at
      Annapurna Studios, Hyderabad.[28][29] It is his second collaboration with
      producer M. S. Raju, who introduced him to the film industry through Devi
      in 1999. Devi introduced his brother Gandham Sagar debut into the music
      industry by "Neeti Mulla" song of the album. The film was a huge hit at
      the box office. The soundtrack fetched him three awards, those include
      Santosham Best Music Director, CineMAA Awards Best Music Director and
      Filmfare Award for Best Music Director – Telugu. A critic described that
      he gave a perfect sound to the film and made a deep impact on the
      audiences with his soulful, melodious and romantic music.[30] He continued
      his "romantic music" style in his next big hit Arya (2004). Devi made his
      first collaboration with Sukumar, who his regular collaborator. The song
      "Aa Ante Amalapuram" enjoyed wide popularity in Telugu states and other
      parts of India. The six-track is considered the best of all time by a
      critic of The Times of India.[31] Another critic from IndiaGlitz cited:
      "The man who should walk away with all the kudos is musician Devi Sri
      Prasad. He is at his inspirational best in the songs and in re-recording
      he is soothing as a cool juice in summer heat. The songs Nuvvante,
      Takadhimithom (Allu Arjun's dance add more weight age), Feel MY Love among
      the six numbers in the film stand out."[32] The next year, he composed the
      album of Tamil remake of Varsham – Mazhai.[33] Devi has eleven album
      releases in 2005 in both Telugu and Tamil, the highest number of releases
      in a single year till date. The soundtrack album of Nuvvostanante
      Nenoddantana which was released on 21 December 2004, made DSP one of the
      most prolific musicians in India. For the first time in his music career,
      Devi remixed the song "Prema Kosamai Volalo" sung by Ghantasala for the
      1951 film Pathala Bhairavi. A reviewer of Idlebrain.com felt DSP had his
      best outcome. He cited that "The songs might not sound great when you
      listen on stereo. But they are entirely different when captured on the
      screen amid situations. Songs do stand out in the film as the best. The
      re-recording and background score are terrific. There is rhythm,
      merriment, emotions upsurge and passion that flows throughout these songs.
      Songs in this film are a part of story narration."[34] He composed film
      score and soundtrack for the action films Bhadra, Bunny and Aaru, which
      received decent success. Devi's made his breakthrough in Tamil with the
      film Sachein, which became successful both commercially and critically.
      The songs "Vaadi Vaadi", "Dai Dai Dai Kattikkoda", "Kanmoodi
      Thirakumbothu" and "Gundu Manga Thoppukkulle" of the soundtrack became
      chartbusters upon its release.[35] 2006–2009: Bommarillu, Arya 2 His next
      releases in 2006 were all romantic films. Of these, coming-of-age film
      Bommarillu was the biggest hit. The music of the film received positive
      response from critics. "Appudo Ippudo", "Nammaka Thappani" and "Bommani
      Geesthe" became chartbusters of the year.[36] A critic from IndiaGlitz
      stated: "Bommani Geesthe is a quaint and quite folksy start. Something
      that Devi Sri Prasad hardly ever tries in recent times. After you listen
      to this, you would want him to try something similar again and again. His
      instrumentation, especially the violin ensemble, is in one word superb.
      The violin rendition of the film's theme in between is very beautiful. A
      good one in the album."[37] It became one of the most sold Telugu music
      albums of the year. A repository of Indian songs has recommended the
      feel-good soundtracks to the audiences.
